Physics for Engineers and Scientists Spring 2015

Project Description:

I made a projectile motion calculator as part of a physics project.
It graphs the projectile in realtime (or closely). 
It can take input and then derive the necessary values to solve projectile motion problems.
This project has a lot of memory issues, but it was a fun project that served its purpose to verify our experiments. 

Take a look at my screenshot!
